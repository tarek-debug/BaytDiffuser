# Arabic Poetry Transformation Project

## Overview

This project aims to transform **modern Arabic poetry** into **polished Classical Arabic verse** using a hybrid approach that combines **Transformer-based language models** and **Diffusion models**. Classical Arabic poetry follows strict structural and stylistic rules, such as adherence to specific meters (علم العروض), consistent rhyme schemes, and an elevated literary style. This project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to bridge the gap between modern and classical poetic forms.

## Objectives

1. **Preserve Semantic Meaning**  
   Ensure the transformed classical poem retains the core meaning and essence of the original modern poem.

2. **Adhere to Classical Poetic Constraints**  
   Generate outputs that strictly follow the rules of classical Arabic poetry, including:
   - Poetic meters and prosody.
   - Consistent rhyme schemes.
   - Vocabulary and syntax reflective of the classical style.

3. **Provide Creative Refinement**  
   Introduce stylistic diversity while ensuring outputs maintain artistic and literary quality.

4. **Demonstrate Model Superiority**  
   Compare outputs from this project with those from general-purpose language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA) to showcase the effectiveness of the hybrid approach.

## Key Features

1. **Hybrid AI Approach**
   - **Transformers:** Handle the linguistic and semantic understanding of modern Arabic poems and generate initial drafts in classical form.
   - **Diffusion Models:** Iteratively refine the transformer outputs to enforce classical poetic constraints, such as rhyme, meter, and stylistic nuances.

2. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Adherence to classical meters and rhyme schemes.
   - Semantic preservation of the original meaning.
   - Human evaluation for artistic quality and authenticity.

3. **Robust Workflow**
   - Preprocessing raw data into clean, tokenized, and structured formats.
   - Training and fine-tuning Transformer and Diffusion models.
   - Generating classical outputs and validating their adherence to literary norms.

---

## Workflow

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Normalize and clean modern Arabic poetry data.
   - Extract stylistic features of Classical Arabic for conditioning the models.

2. **Model Training**
   - Train a Transformer-based model (e.g., AraBERT, AraGPT2) for initial text transformation.
   - Train a Diffusion model for iterative refinement of text embeddings.

3. **Generation**
   - Use the hybrid model pipeline to transform modern Arabic poems into Classical Arabic verse.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Use both automated metrics and human evaluation to assess the quality of the generated poems.

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Adherence to Meters and Rhyme**
   - **Challenge:**Ensuring outputs strictly follow classical poetic rules.
   - **Solution:**Integrate poetic constraints into the conditioning process of the Diffusion model and use rule-based validation.

2. **Alignment Between Models**
   - **Challenge:**Transformers operate on discrete tokens, while Diffusion models work with continuous latent spaces.

   - **Solution:**Use embeddings to map discrete tokens into continuous representations and refine them iteratively.

3. **Evaluation**

   - **Challenge:**Training hybrid models can be resource-intensive.
   - **Solution:**Use pretrained models and fine-tune them on a carefully curated dataset of modern and classical Arabic poetry.

## Expected Outcomes


1. **High-Quality Classical Arabic Poems:**
   Generated outputs that adhere to classical poetic rules and maintain artistic integrity.

2. **Demonstration of Model Superiority:**
   Comparisons showing that the hybrid model outperforms general-purpose language models in generating authentic Classical Arabic poetry.

3. **Reusable Framework:**

   A robust pipeline for future text transformation tasks involving stylistic or linguistic shifts.


----
## Future Extensions

1. **Multilingual Support**: Extend the framework to other languages with rich poetic traditions.

2. **Interactive App** :Develop a user-facing application where users can input modern poetry and receive classical transformations in real-time.

3. **Corpus Expansion**: Curate a larger dataset of paired modern and classical poems to improve training and evaluation.
